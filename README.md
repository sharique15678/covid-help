# ü©∫ covid-help

This project was started to support COVID-19 frontline warriors and people in need during the pandemic.

The website allows users to **submit offers of help** ‚Äî such as oxygen, plasma, hospital beds, and other essential resources ‚Äî for their city. Anyone searching for these resources can find relevant and up-to-date information, helping connect those in need with those who can provide assistance.

Although I never got around to launching it, I am now **open-sourcing the code** in the hope that it may be useful to someone.
